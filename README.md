The patternPermutation.js was the beginning of an attempt at at a permutation problem - it's incomplete.

Name: Eric and Greg


Determine the Big O of the following (and ideally explain briefly why):

Accessing an item by index in an array
O(1)

Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array
O(n)

Pushing an item onto the end of an array
in C
make a new array: O(n)
realloc : O(??????)

in JS
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,undefined,undefined]
plop it onto the end : O()  ??????????

average complexity O-Theta(1)

Upcasing a String
O(n)

Reversing a String
O(n)

Finding the max of an array
O(n)

splitting a String
O(n)

Inserting a value to an Object
O(1)

Retrieving the keys of an Object ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)
//??????????? eric confused
O(n)
