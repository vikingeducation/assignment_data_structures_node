Andrew and Alex


1. Accessing an item by index in an array
We think O(1) but unsure. It should refer to the pointer directly.

2. Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array
O(n)

3. Pushing an item onto the end of an array
O(n)

4. Upcasing a String
If we know the difference between the ascii character codes, then O(n)

5. Reversing a String
O(n)

6. Finding the max of an array
O(n)

7. splitting a String
O(n^2)

8. Inserting a value to an Object
O(1)

9. Retrieving the keys of an Object ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)
O(n)
