Warmup: Big O


Think carefully about what tasks the JavaScript compiler actually has to run through to make them happen (or in other words, what code you'd have to write yourself to do them if the method didn't exist).

Determine the Big O of the following (and ideally explain briefly why):

Accessing an item by index in an array
- O(1)

Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array
- O(n)

Pushing an item onto the end of an array
- already allocated space? O(1)
- if not, O(n)

Upcasing a String
- O(n)

Reversing a String
- O(2n)

Finding the max of an array
- O(n)

splitting a String
- O(n)

Inserting a value to an Object
- O(1)

Retrieving the keys of an Object ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)
- O(n)
